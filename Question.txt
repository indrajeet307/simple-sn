##Summary/Lead-inâ€‹: 
Social network - you want to create a basic social network where a registered user can have a "wall"
of comments/subcomments and reactions. Comments can be written by registered users, including the
current user. Each comment can have subcomments. Each comment/subcomment can have reactions (like,
dislike, +1, etc.)  A user needs to be authenticated with a jwt. You don't need to implement a
system to assign jwts or perform any authentication (you can create a jwt manually and use it for
this purpose), but expect that all the APIs need to verify the jwt. Without a valid jwt, the content
should not be accesible.

## Question:
Write a service that will let a registered user create comments, subcomments, and reactions on any
other user's "wall". Only users who have a valid jwt should be able to create/view content. A
registered user should be able to delete their own comment/subcomment.  A registered user should be
able to fetch comments/subcomments and reactions that were made on their "wall".

1. disallow any request without a jwt, invalid jwt, or expired jwt.

2. a registered user should be able to see all comments/subcomments and reactions made on their
"wall". This should return the comment text, when it was created, who
created it, and any reactions made on it.

3. a registered user can create comments for anyone's wall (including their own).

4. a registered user can create subcomment on any comment (including their own).

5. a registered user can create reaction on any comment/subcomment.

6. a registered user can delete their own comment/subcomment - this will also delete all reactions
made on that comment.

## Things not done
1. Nested comments, comments on comments is not handled
3. Comment and related reaction deletion
4. Query on wall does not return reactions on the post
5. One user one reaction is not handled, single user can post multiple reactions to a post
